description: Build a complete brand visual system and configure a Google Flow project for consistent downstream generation
---

Run the brand-identity skill. Gather the brand brief, explore 3-4 distinct visual directions with `gflow image`, let the user select, build the system (logo, palette, patterns), scope a Flow `--project`, encode the look via `gflow agent instruction add`, and deliver a filled brand guide plus asset library. Execute every gflow command with one shared `--project <name>` for the run (the brand project if one exists) and `--no-headed`; only `gflow auth login` runs headed.
