# Game Assets

Produces concept art, environment painting, character design, cutscene video, UI mockups, and marketing key art for games.

Read `references/quality-gate.md` (mandatory, motion and anti-slop rules) before building.

## When to Use
Game concept art, environment design, character design, cutscenes, key art, game UI mockups.

## Workflow

1. **Game brief** - capture genre, art style, platform, and reference games or films.
2. **Verify session** - run `gflow doctor`. Pick one Flow project for the whole run and pass the same `--project <name>` plus `--no-headed` on every gflow command (reuse `--project <brand>` if a brand exists); split assets across projects only if the user explicitly asks.
3. **Concept exploration** - `gflow image --outputs 8` for wide exploration.
4. **Lock art direction** - lock the direction from user selects.
5. **Environment paintings** - render key locations at different times and weather.
6. **Character designs** - `gflow character create` for consistency.
7. **Cutscenes** - `gflow video` with character references.
8. **Longer cutscenes (optional)** - when a cutscene needs more than one generation, chain it with `gflow extend --media-id <clip>` (ids via `gflow media list`), repeating `--prompt "<what happens next>"` per beat (about 7-8s each, 148s cap) and `--add-clip` to append other rendered cutscene clips; continue later with `--scene <id>` from `gflow scene list`.
9. **UI mockups** - mockups for menus, HUD, and inventory.
10. **Marketing key art** - upscale with `--upscale 4k`.

## Domain Quality Checks
- Single art-style lock per project: painterly, cel-shaded, photorealistic, or pixel.
- Color palette discipline per biome or level.
- Character silhouette readability at thumbnail scale.
- Environment depth: foreground, midground, and background layering.
- UI mockups follow platform conventions: mobile touch targets, console safe zones.
- Concept art includes callouts for materials, scale, and color notes.

## Inheriting characters and brand
Inherit characters via `--character <name>` (from character-pipeline) and the brand or style system via `--project <brand>` (from brand-identity) so the locked art direction and palette carry across every asset.
